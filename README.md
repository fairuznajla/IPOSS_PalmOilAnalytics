# Recommendation Deck and Dashboard on Indonesia's Palm Oil Export Dynamics Analysis

### This team project is an implementation of insights into palm oil in Indonesia and is the final report of the internship program at Indonesia Palm Oil Strategic Studies (IPOSS) company.

We used K-Means and Hierarchical clustering to cluster palm oil export destination countries from Indonesia based on the export volume of each country. We conducted a separate clustering process for two palm oil products, Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and Other Palm Oil (OPO). The results of this analysis provide recommendations for the best clusters with high export volumes, which are potential export destinations. 

In addition, we use multiple linear regression analysis to find out what factors affect the export volume of CPO products. Possible factors are CPO production in Indonesia, the rupiah exchange rate, the world price of CPO and the world price of oil. The results of this analysis provide recommendations for maximising affecting factors to further develop Indonesian palm oil exports.
